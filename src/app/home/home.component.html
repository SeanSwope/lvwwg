      Welcome to the <b>Lehigh Valley Woodworker's Guild</b>.  We hope you enjoy your visit.  Please take some time to explore our site, read about us, and send us your comments.
    </span>
    <span>
      Located in eastern Pennsylvania, about 60 miles north of Philadelphia, our guild is made up of professional and amateur woodworkers. We meet monthly at Woodcraft on Lehigh Street. We welcome membership by all woodworkers, regardless of what they build, their level of skill, style of work, or their profession.
    </span>
    <span>
      Our goal is to do a few things:
    </span>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We educate the public about our Guild and encourage the participation in a hobby/profession that is creative and gratifying.
      </li>
      <li>
        We want to meet other guilds and woodworkers, hopefully making new friends along the way.
      </li>
      <li>
        To advance the knowledge of our members, serve our community and have fun while we're doing it.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve our community by giving back to needy children.
      </li>
    </ul>
